Abstract
This study aims to estimate the wage penalties associated with education-occupation mis-
match for DACA-eligible college graduates. We use data from The American Community
Survey (ACS) to identify whether a worker is vertically mismatched (employed in an occupa-
tion that doesn’t match their educational attainment) or horizontally mismatched (employed
in an occupation that doesn’t match their field of study). We find higher proportions of hori-
zontal mismatch for the DACA-eligible group of college graduates in the post-DACA period.
Relatedly, we find that earnings were approximately 5 percentage points lower. The results
suggest that DACA generated additional wage penalties for the eligible population of college
graduates.
